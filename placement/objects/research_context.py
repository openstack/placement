    that indicate that they share resource via an aggregate association.

    Shared resource providers are marked with a standard trait called
    MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE. This indicates that the provider allows its
    inventory to be consumed by other resource providers associated via an
    aggregate link.

    For example, assume we have two compute nodes, CN_1 and CN_2, each with
    inventory of VCPU and MEMORY_MB but not DISK_GB (in other words, these are
    compute nodes with no local disk). There is a resource provider called
    "NFS_SHARE" that has an inventory of DISK_GB and has the
    MISC_SHARES_VIA_AGGREGATE trait. Both the "CN_1" and "CN_2" compute node
    resource providers and the "NFS_SHARE" resource provider are associated
    with an aggregate called "AGG_1".

    The scheduler needs to determine the resource providers that can fulfill a
    request for 2 VCPU, 1024 MEMORY_MB and 100 DISK_GB.

    Clearly, no single provider can satisfy the request for all three
    resources, since neither compute node has DISK_GB inventory and the
    NFS_SHARE provider has no VCPU or MEMORY_MB inventories.

    However, if we consider the NFS_SHARE resource provider as providing
    inventory of DISK_GB for both CN_1 and CN_2, we can include CN_1 and CN_2
    as potential fits for the requested set of resources.

    To facilitate that matching query, this function returns all providers that
    indicate they share their inventory with providers in some aggregate.
