    The ``placement-api`` WSGI script has been removed. Deployment tooling
    should instead reference the Python module path for the wsgi module in
    Placement, ``placement.wsgi.api:application``, if their chosen WSGI server
    supports this (gunicorn, uWSGI) or implement a `.wsgi` script themselves if
    not (mod_wsgi).
