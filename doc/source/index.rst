===========
 Placement
===========

The placement API service was introduced in the 14.0.0 Newton release within
the nova repository and extracted to the `placement repository`_ in the 19.0.0
Stein release. This is a REST API stack and data model used to track resource
provider inventories and usages, along with different classes of resources.
For example, a resource provider can be a compute node, a shared storage pool,
or an IP allocation pool. The placement service tracks the inventory and usage
of each provider. For example, an instance created on a compute node may be a
consumer of resources such as RAM and CPU from a compute node resource
provider, disk from an external shared storage pool resource provider and IP
addresses from an external IP pool resource provider.

The types of resources consumed are tracked as **classes**. The service
provides a set of standard resource classes (for example ``DISK_GB``,
``MEMORY_MB``, and ``VCPU``) and provides the ability to define custom
resource classes as needed.

Each resource provider may also have a set of traits which describe qualitative
aspects of the resource provider. Traits describe an aspect of a resource
provider that cannot itself be consumed but a workload may wish to specify. For
example, available disk may be solid state drives (SSD).
