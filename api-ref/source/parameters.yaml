    **Starting from microversion 1.24** specifying multiple ``member_of`` query
    string parameters is possible. Multiple ``member_of`` parameters will
    result in filtering providers that are directly or via root provider
    associated with aggregates listed in all of the ``member_of`` query string
    values. For example, to get the providers that are associated with
    aggregate A as well as associated with any of aggregates B or C, the user
    could issue the following query::

        member_of=AGGA_UUID&member_of=in:AGGB_UUID,AGGC_UUID

    **Starting from microversion 1.32** specifying forbidden aggregates is
    supported in the ``member_of`` query string parameter. Forbidden aggregates
    are prefixed with a ``!``. This negative expression can also be used in
    multiple ``member_of`` parameters::

        member_of=AGGA_UUID&member_of=!AGGB_UUID

    would translate logically to "Candidate resource providers must be in AGGA
    and *not* in AGGB."

    We do NOT support ``!`` on the values within ``in:``, but we support
    ``!in:``. Both of the following two example queries return candidate
    resource providers that are NOT in AGGA, AGGB, or AGGC::

        member_of=!in:AGGA_UUID,AGGB_UUID,AGGC_UUID
        member_of=!AGGA_UUID&member_of=!AGGB_UUID&member_of=!AGGC_UUID

    We do not check if the same aggregate uuid is in both positive and negative
    expression to return 400 BadRequest. We still return 200 for such cases.
    For example::

        member_of=AGGA_UUID&member_of=!AGGA_UUID

    would return empty ``allocation_requests`` and ``provider_summaries``,
    while::

        member_of=in:AGGA_UUID,AGGB_UUID&member_of=!AGGA_UUID

    The parameter key is ``member_ofN``, where ``N`` represents a suffix

    The parameter key is ``requiredN``, where ``N`` represents a suffix
    corresponding with a ``resourcesN`` parameter.

    The value format is the same as for the (not granular) ``required``
    parameter; but all of the resources and traits specified in a suffixed
    grouping will always be satisfied by the same resource provider. Separate
    groupings - with or without a suffix - may or may not be satisfied by the
    same provider, depending on the value of the ``group_policy`` parameter.

    **In microversions 1.25 - 1.32** the suffix is a number.

    **Starting from microversion 1.33** the suffix is a string that may be 1-64
    characters long and consist of numbers, ``a-z``, ``A-Z``, ``-``, and ``_``.

    It is an error to specify a ``requiredN`` parameter without a corresponding
    ``resourcesN`` parameter with the same suffix.

    **Starting from microversion 1.39** the granular ``requiredN`` query
    parameter gained support for the ``in:`` syntax as well as the repetition
    of the parameter. So::

    Allocation requests in the response will be for resource providers that

    providers will *collectively* contain all of the required traits. These
    traits may be satisfied by any provider in the same non-sharing tree or
    associated via aggregate as far as that provider also contributes resource
    to the request. **Starting from microversion 1.22** traits which
    are forbidden from any resource provider contributing resources to the
    request may be expressed by prefixing a trait with a ``!``.

    **Starting from microversion 1.39** the ``required`` query parameter can be
    repeated. The trait lists from the repeated parameters are ANDed together.
    So::

      required=T1,!T2&required=T3

    means T1 and not T2 and T3.

    Also **starting from microversion 1.39** the ``required`` parameter
    supports the syntax::

      required=in:T1,T2,T3

    which means T1 or T2 or T3.

    Mixing forbidden traits into an ``in:`` prefixed value is not supported and
    rejected. But mixing a normal trait list and an ``in:`` prefixed trait list
    in two query params within the same request is supported. So::

      required=in:T3,T4&required=T1,!T2

    The UUID of the immediate parent of the resource provider.

    * Before version ``1.37``, once set, the parent of a resource provider
      cannot be changed.

    * Since version ``1.37``, it can be set to any existing provider UUID
      excepts to providers that would cause a loop. Also it can be set to null
      to transform the provider to a new root provider. This operation needs
      to be used carefully. Moving providers can mean that the original rules
      used to create the existing resource allocations may be invalidated
      by that move.
