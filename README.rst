**Warning: This repository is currently in a state of flux as the placement
service is extracted from nova. While that is happening this repository is
not yet fully working.**

If you are viewing this README on GitHub, please be aware that placement
development happens on `OpenStack git
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/placement/>`_ and `OpenStack
gerrit <https://review.openstack.org>`_.

OpenStack Placement
===================

OpenStack Placement provides an HTTP service for managing, selecting,
and claiming providers of classes of inventory representing available
resources in a cloud.

API
---

To learn how to use Placement's API, consult the documentation available
online at:

- `Placement API Reference <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/placement/>`__

For more information on OpenStack APIs, SDKs and CLIs in general, refer to:

- `OpenStack for App Developers <https://www.openstack.org/appdev/>`__
- `Development resources for OpenStack clouds
  <https://developer.openstack.org/>`__

Operators
---------

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Placement, consult the
documentation available online at:

- `OpenStack Placement <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/>`__

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

- `Bug Tracker <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova>`__

**For the time being bugs in placement should be created in the Nova bug
tracker with a tag of ``placement``.**

Developers
----------

For information on how to contribute to Placement, please see the contents of
CONTRIBUTING.rst.

Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed in the HACKING.rst
file, and pass all tests.

Further developer focused documentation is available at:
