Operators

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Placement, consult the
documentation available online at:

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

- `Bug Tracker <https://bugs.launchpad.net/placement>`__
- `File new Bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/placement/+filebug>`__
